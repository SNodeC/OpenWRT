## What's inside

[SNode.C](https://github.com/SNodeC/snode.c) provides a C++ networking framework,
runtime libraries and tools. [MQTTSuite](https://github.com/SNodeC/mqttsuite)
provides an MQTT broker, bridge, integrator, command-line client, store and mapping
plugins. Install binaries with your package manager; no compilation is needed.

## Quick start

### Installation

Check your [distribution guide](#distributions) for prerequisites, especially
CRB/EPEL on Rocky Linux. Keep official repositories enabled for dependencies.

**Linux — Raspberry Pi OS, Debian, Ubuntu, Rocky Linux or Fedora:**

```sh
# Download the installer; curl and CA certificates must be installed.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SNodeC/OpenWRT/main/ci/install-feed.sh \
  -o /tmp/snodec-install-feed.sh &&
sudo sh /tmp/snodec-install-feed.sh
# For preparation only, replace the last command with:
# sudo sh /tmp/snodec-install-feed.sh --prepare
```

**OpenWrt — run as root:**

```sh
# Download the installer with HTTPS-capable wget.
wget -O /tmp/snodec-install-feed.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SNodeC/OpenWRT/main/ci/install-feed.sh &&
sh /tmp/snodec-install-feed.sh
# For preparation only, replace the last command with:
# sh /tmp/snodec-install-feed.sh --prepare
```

The installer checks the target, configures its signed package source and installs
both complete project sets; `--prepare` only configures the source and refreshes indexes.
Prefer manual setup? See your distribution guide.
